## Final Report:

#Epicycle of Analysis

# Q1..What is change in  life expectancy in last 15 years ?

# Q2  How income has improved since 2000 ?

## --Data: gapminder : It is a summary of demographics of world  population broadly categorized into 6 regions like America,East Asia & Pacific, etc. 

#Variables : Country- List of country  , Year- data year, Life- Life expectancy , Population- Total Population ,Income - Income of country &  Region- Broader Segment like continent.

# Data Expolration: 

#1.



#Subsetting data from 2000 to accomodate expectations of data
```{r xx}
gap1<- subset(gapminder, gapminder$Year>= 2000)

```

#summary of variables
summary(gap1)

#Summary of Life Expetancy, Population & Income  by Region  Over Years
```{r gap1}
life1<-  aggregate(gap1, by=list(gap1$region, gap1$Year), 
                    FUN=mean, na.rm= TRUE)
```


#Plot: Overall Life Expectancy  by Year
```{r gap1_1}
ggplot(gap1, aes( Year,life, colour = region)) + 
  geom_point()
```


#Summary of Income by Region Over Years
```{r gap11}
ggplot(gap1, aes( Year,income, colour = region)) + 
  geom_point()
```

#Summary of Population by Region Over Years
```{r gap12}
ggplot(gap1, aes( Year,population, colour = region)) + 
  geom_point()
```


#Creating  scatterplots with regression lines for overall life expectations
```{r gap13}
ggplot(gap1, aes(x= Year, y=life)) +
     geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
     geom_smooth() 
```

# From Regression smoothing we can see life expectancy has improced from appr. 68 to 72 from 2000 to 2015

#Regression for overall income
```{r gap14}
ggplot(gap1, aes(x= Year, y= income)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    #  circles
     geom_smooth(method=lm,   #  linear regression line
                se=FALSE)    # No shaded confidence region
```
#Overall Income  has remain stable from 2000 to 2015

#Average Population, Life expectancy and Income by Year & Region.
```{r gap15}
 aggregate(gap1,
                by = list(gap1$Year, gap1$region),
                FUN = mean, na.rm= TRUE)
```

# Plot of Average Life expectancy from 2000 to 2015.
```{r agg16}
 ggplot(agg1,aes(x= Year, y= life)) +
     geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
     geom_smooth() 
```
#Overall Average Life Expectancy has improved in 15 years from Year 2000 app. 68 to 72

# Plot of Average Income from 2000 to 2015
```{r agg1}
 ggplot(agg1,aes(x= Year, y= income)) +
      geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
      geom_smooth() 
```
#Overall Average Income has steadily incresaed since 2000 from appr. 14,500 to 16,500

#Findings
# Overall life expectancy : Mean=  69.89, min = 37 , max= 84.10 , median = 72.2                                         Overall Income : Mean = 16,250 , min = 441, max = 133,734 , median = 9,028                                            From Regression & Scatter plots and by summary of aggregate data both Life Expectancy and Income in the population    has increased in last 15 years from year 2000 to 2015.
